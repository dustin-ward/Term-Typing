### Usage

After executing the program, the text will appear greyed out. This means the keyboard is not active. Simply press 'enter' to begin typing.

Green characters have been correctly typed, while a red character means a wrong input has been received. You cannot advance until the correct key has been pressed.

Pressing 'enter' while typing will re-generate a new set of words and reset your position. Pressing 'esc' will return the application to the inactive state and reset your typing progress.

You can exit the program by pressing 'esc'.

### Zen Mode üßò

Pass the `-zen` flag to the program to enter zen mode.

Zen mode removes the status bar for a stress-free typing environment.
